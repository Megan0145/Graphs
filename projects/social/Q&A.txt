QUESTION ONE:
To create 100 users with an average of 10 friends each, how many times would you need to call add_friendship()? Why?

add_friendship() would be called 500 times. 
We are using a formula to generate the number of friendships that should be generated when populating the graph with users and frienships. 
The number of friendships to be generated will be the result of:
        number of users * average number of friendships per user // 2
Which in this case is:
        100 * 10 // 2
        = 500        


QUESTION TWO:
If you create 1000 users with an average of 5 random friends each, what percentage of other users will be in a particular user's extended 
social network? What is the average degree of separation between a user and those in his/her extended network?
